			<br><p><b>Issues: </b>This is a heavily issue-based mod. There are five different issues in-game:</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Economics:</b> </b> The U.S. is a <i>center-left</i> nation on econ, especially in the Midwest. Notable red states that are economically left of center include Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, and West Virginia. Waving the flag of economic nationalism is often a winning move, especially if you have a suitable foil of a non-populist opponent. At the same time, some conservative economic policy can result in negative economic effects that will hurt you; compromising on economics will not hurt you globally that much because the base is used to it from the establishment. The Sun Belt states like Texas, GA, FL, and Arizona are center-right on economics.<br><br><i>Sample in-game scores (+1 is most leftist, -1 is the most conservative):</i><br> -0.6: Pat '20. 0.1: Buttigieg/Chelsea Clinton. 0.25: U.S. political weighed mean. 0.2: Young '24. -0.1: Trump '20. 0.45: Clinton/Shapiro. 0.7: Castro/Chelsea Clinton.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Globalism:</b> </b> This represents a mix of foreign policy, trade policy, general trust in the system, and association with the establishment. While the U.S. as a whole is more globalist than not, the crucial swing states - including Nevada, North Carolina, and especially the Midwest - are anti-globalist. However, the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Georgia are globalist; notable red states that are globalist include Florida, Texas, and Utah. Going globalist couples with a moderate economic strategy to try and win the Sun Belt - however, that will get you the real-world conundrum of winning the popular vote and flopping in the electoral college and Senate. Furthermore many anti-globalist options have popularity costs so you'll want to be judicial about them. Going anti-war is an anti-globalist option that will win over anti-war.<br><br><i>Sample in-game scores (+1 is most establishment, -1 is most anti-establishment):</i><br> 0.6: Walz/Chelsea Clinton. -0.4: Young or Pat. 0.1: U.S. political weighed mean. -0.2: Pat '20. 0.5: Clinton/Shapiro. 0.75: Booker/Cooper.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Social issues:</b> The U.S. is <i>center-right</i> on social issues - the Midwest is fairly socially conservative, while the Sun Belt states of Georgia and Arizona are both socially liberal. The only red state left-of-center on social issues is Alaska. Running too far to the right on social issues will not only upset the general populace, but also workers and Latinos as well. However, running to the center on social issues will upset staffers and small-dollar donors - who are predominantly anti-globalist social-conservative religious republicans (like yours truly) - represented by a global multiplier hit.<br><br><i> Sample in-game scores (+1 is most socially conservative, -1 is most socially liberal):</i><br> 0.4: Trump or Pat. 0.3 - Young '24. -0.05: U.S. political weighed mean. -0.2: Buttigieg/Chelsea Clinton. -0.3: Clinton/Shapiro. -0.7: Walz/Chelsea Clinton. </p>
			
			<br><p><b>Immigration:</b> The U.S. is <i>center-right</i> on immigration - the Midwest is fairly conservative, and the border states (TX/AZ/NM) are also considerably more right-wing on immigration than you'd expect from their general political leanings. No red states are left-of-center on immigration. Being too permissive on immigration will not only upset the general populace, but also make workers upset that you're depressing wages and Latinos upset that they're cutting the line. But being too hard on immigration will also upset small-dollar donors and more moderate-leaning Latinos - especially those Spanish speakers who are first or second-generation - resulting in global multiplier and Latino approval hits. Immigration is also good for the economy.<br><br> <br><br><i>Sample in-game scores (+1 is most pro-immigration, -1 is most anti-immigration):</i><br>-0.4: Trump or Pat '20. -0.3 - Young '24. 0 - Pat '07 and Buttigieg/Chelsea Clinton. -0.1: U.S. political weighed mean. 0.75: Clinton/Shapiro.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Inflation:</b> This is a special issue, the only one that changes values. It starts at 1 (no inflation at all) nationwide, and every question, it moves based on the inflation rate, with the issue score itself reflecting the cumulative price increase since the start of your Presidency. Your opponents move with it - you do not, except by picking the right answers (e.g. advocating cutting spending, looking like you're doing things to worry about inflation) to help neutralize it. It's much more important in the coastal states than the heartland - the mod's theory of politics is that this issue score is the primary reason Ds slid hard in e.g. CA/NY/etc. in 2024.</p>
			
			<br><p>Other than inflation, no state issue scores will ever change in this game - but your opponent will have their own issue scores, and the relative importance of issue scores can and will change during the game. Due to limited attention spans, getting attention for one issue will suck attention away from others. If you raise the banner of economic nationalism and de-emphasize everything else, you can get historically working-class or swing states like Colorado, Virginia, and Oregon to consider you against the left opponent. Pat’s campaign questions have the dual purpose of increasing the importance of the issue you're attacking the opponent on, and moving the opponent on that issue. Pat is much better at attacking opponents on economic policy than other subjects, but that may not always be the best subject for attack.</p>
			
			<br><p>Regarding <b>state multipliers:</b> This game tries to avoid most uses of state multipliers, going by issues instead. Your opponents are differentiated almost exclusively by issue scores (minus minor home state effects.) State multipliers are used for several purposes - primarily for demographic effects - E.g. Making workers/Latinos happy/unhappy will result in nationwide movement expressed by state multipliers weighted to the percentage of the voter-eligible population that are workers/Latinos. <br><br>They also come into play when you specifically campaign in a state, when you select a VP for home-state effects. Finally, the last question will result in movement in each state consisting of the difference between the real-world 2024 538 final forecast and the 2024 actual results to reflect the polling miss (whichever state you campaign in last will have that drop reduced.) 
			
			</p>
			<br><p><b>Variable mechanics</b>
			
			<br><br><b>Fervor</b> (internally called authenticity) - This goes up when Pat gives in-character answers and goes down when he gives out-of-character answers; it also naturally decays over time. It's mainly checked on Q30 - you want to keep it at 8+ for that question. You really don't want it -8 or lower for Q30. Having it low can also result in a bad debate later - too many compromises makes Pat crash out.
			
			<br><br><b>Political capital</b> - Affects your deal-making capability. This is limited to what your opposing party is willing to bargain on - no amount of political capital will convince Murkowski/Romney to remove the filibuster, or Ds to support things like the six week ban, mass deportations, or repealing gay marriage. Its utility usually goes down significantly starting in 2023, because Democrats are less willing to bargain with you - unless you go the full bipartisan route.
			
			<br><br><b>Party unity</b> - Primarily affects downballot results - each point gives +/- 0.5% margin-wise for downballot elections in non-presidential years. In 2024, each point will translate into a +/- 0.25% multiplier for you at the start of the campaign, and a +/-0.25% downballot effect at election. Party unity also affects how much support gets leeched from you to the Libertarian Party or any third-party centrists, as well as the willingness of the party to support you if you try to get a Republican speaker.
			
			<br><br><b>Base support</b> - anti-war, workers, and Latinos are separately tracked. Your answer in Q1 determines how high their expectations are - the default is +3 happy/-3 unhappy thresholds. If you promised big and raised expectations, it's +5/-1 for workers+Latinos and +4/-2 for anti-war. If you lowered expectations, it's +1/-5 for workers+Latinos. Approvals are not only affected by your actions as President and on the campaign trail, but also by who your opponent is. The relationship between the approvals (which is highest or lowest) determine who your opponent is.
			
			<br><br><b>The economy</b> - the nation goes into recession when this is negative. Brief small recessions are very survivable, the country going into a new Great Recession is not. Having a recession followed by strong economic recovery is not too bad - the penalty will rapidly fade as the economy improves (the "Morning in America" effect.) Additionally, there is essentially a floor to how much you can lose here - no matter how awful the economy gets and stays, it won't take away more than around 20% of your initial support. Thanks to the Phillips curve, recessions will tend to lower inflation; an overheated economy (>10, or especially >12) will tend to raise inflation. Rare deflation will meanwhile hurt the economy (Japan-ification.) Beyond legislation and not screwing up, this is heavily determined by the actions of Federal Reserve, who a President gets to appoint and has no oversight over.
			
			<br><br><b>Inflation</b> - The rate is how much prices are going up annualized; the cumulative inflation is how much prices have gone up since you were inaugurated, and is what sucks away much of your support. The real-world value is prices up ~19% over 2021-2024; in-game, a range of 13-41% is possible. You can aggressively fight inflation, or you can just wait for the supply chains to get sorted out and the Fed to act. Overall, good politics is different from good policy, and the compromises needed to keep inflation in check and improve the economy are sometimes not worth it.
			<br><br>To deal with inflation, options include spending less, raising taxes or cutting spending (austerity), getting others to spend less (e.g. More Medicare for Some), appointing an aggressive Fed chair (Kashkari goes from very dovish to very hawkish at the start of 2022, both in-game and in the real-world), avoiding things that will blow up the supply chain more (e.g. letting shipping lanes get subjected to war, losing Taiwan's microchip factories), and doing things that will help sort out the supply chain faster (e.g. removing fossil fuel moratoriums, getting America working again faster by reopening schools early, not-IRA, etc.)
			
			<br><br><b>Party Ideology</b> - This mainly affects the endings. Namely, if you get re-elected with a friendly House and Senate, are Rs willing to go for a six week ban? The criteria is having a trifecta and "Senate seats + econ nationalism + political capital/2 >=60". Social conservatism is largely cosmetic (if you go too progressive, the party won't be willing to repeal gay marriage or get comprehensive immigration reform though.) If you exactly copy the real-world, this moves the party a lot more to the right than the real world - my excuse is that *Pat* going full establishment would be much more dramatic party-wise than Trump doing so.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Other mechanics</b>
			
			<br><br><b>The assassination</b> is conducted by Thomas Matthew Crooks, who shoots you as long as you show up in the greater Pittsburgh area for him to target (by campaigning in West Mifflin, PA.) Otherwise he shoots your opponent. From what we know of him - looking up public appearances of many prominent figures including both Biden and Trump - it seems clear that he was an equal-opportunity assassin who'd have targeted the first major-party candidate to show up near him. Being the assassination target will create a small backlash in favor of the victim, but this is intentionally small on both sides (up to a 2.5% margin swing) - partly because Trump's real-world one was small and partly because I did not want to incentivize the player to get Pat killed.
			<br><br>Surviving an assassination will help you recover from staying in after a bad debate (rally-to-the-flag effect); if you are the target of an assassination and replaced by Todd Young, Young will get more political benefit from options that double down on supporting Pat and it will cost him more to throw Pat under the bus. Dying to an assassination after a bad debate, meanwhile, will fuel conspiracy theories that Young or the establishment was behind it, hurting the ticket.
			
			<br><br>The overall <b>2021 and 2022 election results</b> are determined by the national popular vote margin and party unity. Important state positions (both crucial governorship positions in 2022, state legislatures in 2022/2023, or each of the Senate races in 2024) are tracked behind the scenes and determined by local margins and party unity. They aren't publicly displayed because I realize that 99% of players do not care about who won the Virginia state legislature in 2023. It is impossible to do better than red ripple in the 2022 midterms - the Doylist explanation is that I did not want to write additional branching. The Watsonian explanation is that Pat’s voter base is akin to Trump’s - intermittent and less willing to turn out in midterms.
			
			<br><br><b>Third party candidates</b> will see RFK Jr. disproportionately take votes from Democrats (however he will drop out and endorse any progressive Democrat), while centrists and Libertarian Party candidates will predominately take votes from you. A viability mechanic means that third party candidates tend to fade over time (generally, 50% by the time of the election) so long as they are not serious candidates. However, if you do worse than a 3rd-party candidate in one state, they may start taking more votes instead - imagine that local figures see them as viable and begin endorsing them over time. Third-party votes do translate down into downballot votes too. 
			
			<br><br><b>Foreign interference</b> always occurs on Q40. The opinion of Russia+China towards the player are tracked over time, and depending on how strongly they feel, they may engage in anything from deepfakes to hacking (a la 2016) to social media interference from most to least impactful. Notably, banning Tiktok by the time foreign interference has happened (either getting it automatically banned via sanctions or war with the PRC, or getting it banned by Labor Day on the TikTok question) will roughly halve the impact of foreign interference. (I don't have any special knowledge about TikTok, but it's very clear that this is something that multiple world governments are very concerned about.)
			
			<br><br><b>The Federal Reserve</b> will act starting on Q16 to hike rates to hurt the economy and reduce inflation when inflation is high and lower rates to help the economy and increase inflation when inflation is low and the economy needs help. Their strategy varies by Fed chair. <br><b>Kashkari</b> appears dovish to Pat at the start, but does a 180 shortly after to push aggressively for rate hikes against inflation. His behavior pattern in-game is "responds aggressively to all crises - recession and inflation - prioritizing the latter. Acts as a mega-dove to improve the economy when inflation is low and there's no recession." Because of his tendency to aggressively respond, he can easily overreact to small changes. <br><b>Powell</b> is hawkish, prioritizing inflation over the economy.<br> <b>Clarida</b> is dovish - he will still prioritize inflation, but he will be more cautious about raising rates in order to try and minimize economic damage. <br><b>Miran</b> is dovish by default, but also the only person who listens to what you say though he won't do anything do acknowledge that - this is a giant stretch, but I did want to give the player more agency here. If you tell him to raise rates, he acts the same as Powell. If you tell him to keep rates low, he goes mega-dove, being cautious about hiking rates to avoid recession and aggressively acting against all recessions unless inflation is 10+%.
			
			<br><br> <b>Speaker Golden</b> is achieved by getting a blue ripple in 2022, and going for the option while you have party unity 4+, political capital 3+, and a secret variable bipartisanship 4+. Bipartisanship is increased by going establishment, being solicitous to Ds (whether or not it succeeds), not attacking Ds, and not doing things like abandoning Israel/Ukraine that both parties really hate. The variable also becomes useful for working with a Democratic Congress in 2023-2024, though it's intentionally hard to do so. If you keep Congress happy, you can get up to two Grand Bargains with Speaker Golden - getting an achievement. (If you fail, you get a question notifying you that Speaker Golden is in trouble in lieu of the second legislation opportunity.) 
			<br><br>The other Speakers are largely cosmetic, but they are differentiated by a cooperativeness variable - Golden is +10, Katherine Clark is +2, Pete Aguilar is +1, Hakeem Jeffries is 0, Ted Lieu is -1. This is checked when you push for legislation (i.e. stimulus in a bad economy or changes to a CHIPS bill.)
			
			<br><br><b>The prosecution of Clinton</b> succeeds only if you push for it and have appointed a domestic conservative cabinet - Matt Gaetz goes for it, Jeff Sessions will flatly refuse you.
			
			<br><br><b>Your initial cabinet</b> determines a lot of policy at the start of your term. A domestic conservative cabinet can arrest Clinton, will aggressively push fossil fuel leases on federal lands, will oppose unions at the Department of Labor and will have a restrictive immigration policy. A conservative foreign policy cabinet will withhold arms from Ukraine until they fully implement Minsk II, from Israel until they stop expanding settlements, from Taiwan until they fully disavow independence rhetoric that provokes China, and from UAE and the Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen and murdering Khashoggi. Establishment versions of both are basically real-world Trump.
			
			<br><br><b>Your initial opponents</b> are deterministic. If you did not jail Clinton, then Clinton is always the nominee with running mates Josh Shapiro (if the constituency with the highest approval still is not happy), Pete Buttigieg (who beats Mike Pence in the 2022 election for Young’s seat)(if workers are happy and the highest approval), Tim Walz (if anti-war are happy and the highest approval), or Julian Castro (if Latinos are happy and the highest approval.) If Clinton was jailed, the opposing tickets are Newsom/Lujan (if Latinos have the lowest approval of all three), Chelsea Clinton/Shapiro (if workers have the lowest approval), or Gretchen Whitmer/Cory Booker (if anti-war have the lowest approval.)
			<br><br> If something happens to your opponent, his or her VP will lead the ticket. If the opponent was Clinton, the new VP candidate will always be Chelsea Clinton. Otherwise the possible replacement tickets are Lujan/Buttigieg, Shapiro/Kamala Harris, or Booker/Roy Cooper.
			
			<br><br><b>True randomness</b> exists in this mod when you are intentionally gambling with disaster - namely, playing hardball on the debt ceiling (trying to invoke the 14th Amendment), or tickling the dragon's tail by pushing Russia/China to the breaking point. Variable-modified randomness also exists - e.g. the bad debate is guaranteed with fervor -10 or below and guaranteed not to happen if fervor is not negative, but in between it's random with (-fervor*10)% chance. The chance of whistleblower when sitting on serious foreign interference is also randomized but modified via how much the national security establishment likes/dislikes you. </p>
			
			<br><p><b>Ending aspects</b>
			
			<br><br><b>Fighting Oligarchy</b> is entirely deterministic. The hidden variable Democratic radicalism is tracked throughout the game - doing the logical things like prosecuting Clinton or de facto closing the southern border increase it. Winning the election on election night while losing the popular vote by a lot also increases it. How willing Ds are to go for it depends heavily on their ticket (full progressive tickets like Clinton/Shapiro are the most willing to go for it; full moderate tickets like Newsom/Lujan are the least willing), which can dramatically reduce the variable. Behind the scenes, key downballot results like control of governorships, state legislatures, and SoS races is tracked in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 elections. Virginia, for instance, will only be vulnerable to Fighting Oligarchy if you've slid enough in Virginia in 2023 for Democrats to take control of the legislature behind the scenes. <br><br>Overall, states are vulnerable to Fighting Oligarchy if your popular vote margin of victory is smaller than 0.5%* Democratic Radicalism (where Ds have a trifecta), or 0.2%* Democratic Radicalism (if they only have the legislature.) If the collective states that are vulnerable is enough to flip the election or throw it to the House, they go for it. Mechanically, in states where they have full control, you're unable to dispute it and the electors there are awarded to Democrats in the state details (regardless of what it's colored on the map.) In states where they have partial control, both your electors and D electors will be sent, resulting in the electors for that state being zeroed out to reflect the deadlock. <br><br> Afterwards, the military can weigh in on the next slide - it does so if a hidden variable "blob_approval" (only used here and one other place) is at least 5. You increase this variable by doing things that agree with what the foreign policy establishment want (e.g. arming Ukraine and Israel, banning TikTok) and having an opponent repugnant to them (e.g. Cory Booker.) 
			
			<br><br><b>Faithless electors</b> only affect Young, when he's done something to strongly annoy conservatives (e.g. throwing Pat under the bus.) This is a random effect dependent on Right Anger (internally conservative_anger) - the value is reduced by 2 and then halved if you officially won (victory makes up for a lot of sins and they're reluctant to throw the election), and then halved if Pat is alive (he tries to talk them out of it.) Afterwards, every single elector has a Right Anger% chance of going faithless. This can potentially see the election thrown to a contingent election.
			
			<br><br><b>Contingent elections</b> occur when the election is deadlocked (usually because it's a 269-269 tie or Young’s electors went faithless.) This will inevitably result in a Democratic president via the House. The Vice Presidency depends on a Senate vote; this can result in unusual VP scenarios - e.g. Hillary with Tucker Carlson as VP if you picked him as running mate and have the Senate (such a split White House with President Clinton gives a unique ending slide.)<br><br> Furthermore, a very edge-case scenario is written into the game in which, if the Vice Presidency is empty on Election Night (from Pat getting assassinated, Ds controlling the Senate, and Chuck Schumer being Chuck Schumer), if the election goes to a contingent vote, and if the 2024 Senate election results give a 50-50 tie, <i>there is no Vice President to break the tie</i> meaning that the tie will continue indefinitely until someone dies, someone crosses party lines, or a new Senate is elected in 2026. I am not certain this is actually possible in-game - I'd guess it isn't due to the sheer impossibility of getting a red wave in 2022, and gaining 2 Senate seats in 2024 while deadlocking the electoral college - but there is a very well-deserved achievement on CTS if you somehow manage it.
			
			<br><br>To get a <b>Gaza ceasefire in 2024</b>, you need to never arm Israel and get re-elected. Namely, in 2021 you need to either appoint a foreign policy cabinet, or annoy Murkowski enough for her to switch parties and then get a second chance to disarm Israel. Then, refuse to arm them after October 7. If you get re-elected, Netanyahu - who was running short of artillery shells and manpower and desperately hoping you'd lose - caves shortly after the election, giving you a special ending slide and a CTS achievement.
						
			<br><br>To access a <b>secret ending</b>, you need to exactly follow what I've assessed as the real-world options. These are answers IDs. 1002, 2004, 3001, 4001, 5001, 6001, 7001, 8004, 9004, 10202, 11001, 12002, 13103, 14002, 15001, 16002, 17002, 18002, 19002, 20004, 21002, 22102, 23003, 24101, 25002, 26002, 27202, 28002, 29103, 30101, 31104, 32002, 33003, 34003, 35102, 36102, 37101, 38602, 39502, 40802, 41402, 42901, 43402, 44104. The initial ending slide will be as normal (though the results may look very familiar), the next ending slide is the secret one. This also gives you a CTS achievement.

You want it too, you'll fight like hell for it - but they haven't spent thirty years watching, observing and notating the art of the deal and the trade. They don't understand that the President isn't a dictator who can do anything he wants with executive orders; that without Congress, you're just an old man fanning himself on the veranda of his Northern Virginia home, drinking Mint Julep and pining for the day when the south will rise again.<br><br>They expect you to get up, go. Fight a war with the establishment, when you've played this game long enough to know you're not getting anything done without working with that establishment. You want to give them everything you promised; you'll fight tooth and nail to achieve what you can, accomplishing the impossible one step at a time. But you've hung around Washington long enough to know: <i>The nation asks the President for miracles, when he's only a man.</i></div>",

But this country's wounds go deep, and uniting this fractured party meant making some hard decisions. And he was the one who could help bring in the \"Anyone but Pat\" moderates who were wary, skeptical, of what they call your \"radical agenda.\"<br><br>Young knew how to play the game in ways that sometimes made you shake your head. But he also understood, in his own way, the need to reform it, to challenge some of what had gone wrong, even if he’d done so from within. Millions are looking to you both now - to deliver the changes they've demanded. You're here to end endless wars, address the environment, take on Big Pharma and the globalist class, and ban abortion. You know that Young has defended the systems you mean to tear down. But you also know that, for the country to move forward, you need him with you.

Now all those Chinese forces have been moved [to threaten] our friends on Taiwan and against our country. And the weapons are being bought to fight a war against a naval power in the western Pacific, the United States.

Mr. Buchanan argued that American commitments around the world far exceed the country's ability to meet them. At some point, he predicted, we could find ourselves in multiple wars on several continents without the means to achieve victory. In Walter Lippmann's phrase, that could spell"foreign policy bankruptcy." To forestall this scenario, Mr. Buchanan called on the United States to undertake a top to bottom review of its global commitments.Among the wars he warned we might have to fight if we did not limit our commitments was a war against terrorism. Do our global commitments possibly invite attacks of terrorism? If so, which ones precisely -- the commitment to Israel? The commitment to Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf Arab regimes (which commitments we made in order to provide for secure supplies of oil)? The commitment to free trade and globalism? Though he never explained which commitments exactly might be responsible for such a war, Mr. Buchanan laid out the course such a war might take.<br><br>- Pat Buchanan", color: "lightblue"},

Valens has his modern counterpart in George W. Bush. In May 2006, Republican senators at Bush's urging joined Democrats to offer a blanket amnesty to 12 million illegal aliens and permit US businesses to go abroad and bring in foreign workers.

The Germans were driven out from Eastern Europe after the horrors of Nazi occupation, the Serbs forced to flee the lands Milošević soaked in blood, and your own people who carried the scars of the Potato famine built the American nation, culminating with Kennedy. <i>When will it end?

Now here you are, on the opposite side of it, sitting in the Oval Office as another American is taken by the void of politics.

The simple act of turning your head, even moving your eyes, sends a wave of vertigo crashing over you as you struggle not to retch.

They're waking up, and when they're ready, we'll break the globalists once and for all." A pause, and then a chuckle - disgusting, arrogant, filled with malice. Your stomach churns. The cadence is perfect, the Southern drawl just right. But everything about the words screams <i>wrong, wrong, wrong</i>. You would never even <i>think</i> this, let alone say it - and yet, across America, it's spreading like wildfire. Your press team has put out denials and statements already, pointed to the signs of manipulation, declared it an obvious fake - but obvious to who?
