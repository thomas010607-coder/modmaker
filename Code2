So you'll walk to the podium and lay the facts out to America - our enemies are spreading lies and division, trying to tear us apart, but we will rise above their hatred. We are more than their fear, more than their lies - and the soul of this nation will endure, no matter what they throw at us!"

CISA will put out a statement about what they know; you'll stay laser-focused on the electorate, rallying your supporters, moving the needle where it counts. You can't let them distract you from what's at stake!"

So you'll walk to the podium and lay out the facts: American democracy is under attack by foreign disinformation. These dictators are seeking to pick our leaders like they pick their puppets! But we cannot, will not be cowed; we will stand strong - all of us together. The fate of America must rest in the hands of its people, not the hands of its enemies!"

But you can't let this distract you - most Americans are tired about hearing about Russia, about democracy, about emails. They want to know who's going to help them put food on the table, who's going to fight for their right to organize. So you'll keep your eyes on the prize - the electorate, your campaign, your message, and the people who believe in you."

You'll try to hold events where you emphasize that you're fighting for everyone who has to work for a living, who struggles to balance a budget against corporate greed - whether they're toiling at a factory or typing away at a desk. We're all in this together against the greed of the globalists!"

You have to remind them that you've fought your whole life for fair wages, available jobs, their right to work, and a future where the rich can't keep exploiting them. You have to win them back because when the working class is behind us, we win."
